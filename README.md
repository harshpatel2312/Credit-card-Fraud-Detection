# Online-Fraud-Detection

In today's digital age, online transactions are increasingly becoming targets for fraudulent activities. To address this critical issue, I embarked on a project to develop a robust machine learning model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. This project combines data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to tackle online fraud effectively.

## Objective:
The project aimed to build a machine learning model which can identify a fraudulent transaction.

## Methodology:
- Utilized a publicly available dataset from Kaggle which contained credit card transactions.
- Utilized advanced statistical methods and Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) to clean, process, and analyze large datasets, identifying key trends and patterns.
- Created interactive visualizations of the dataset using Plotly.
- Identified correlation between various features of the dataset.
- Built and evaluated machine learning model (Decision Tree) using scikit-learn to predict future fraud in online transactions.

## Results:
- Model performed with an accuracy of 99.97%.

## Conclusion:
Model accurately identified various new transactions as fraudulent or not, based on the data it was fed with..
